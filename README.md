Innovated a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for computer vision application targeting the classification of
histopathological lung cancer tissue images. The model was trained on 220,000 images and tested on 57,000 images.
Achieved an accuracy of 97.09%. Conducted a performance comparison of different architectures such as InceptionV3,
Random Forest, and VGG16.
